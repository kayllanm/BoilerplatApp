# BoilerplatApp
- BoilerplatApp is a skeleton app that follows the design requirements up to 70% - 80%
- the main goal of this app is to get all libraries working in their basic setup base on the requirements
- the code still needs some refactoring and cleanup done to it, like creating reusable components and inline styling needs to be removed and moved into its own file

## What does this app solve?
- it basically solves the scaffolding of the project for when it starts and its a playground for adding and removing pieces of the project 
- it also gives you a good understanding of what to expect
